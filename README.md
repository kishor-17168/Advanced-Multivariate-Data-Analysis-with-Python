## 1- Introduction
This repository contains the completed assignment for the course **Advanced Multivariate Techniques**. The primary objective of this assignment is to apply and demonstrate various multivariate statistical methods using Python, based on the topics covered in the course.  

The tasks include practical implementations of methods such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**, **Factor Analysis**, **DBSCAN clustering**, **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**, and **Correspondence Analysis**. Each problem is solved using relevant datasets, with step-by-step coding, visualization, and interpretation of results.  

The assignment aims to reinforce theoretical concepts through computational practice, enhance analytical skills, and develop proficiency in applying multivariate techniques to real-world data scenarios.
